    <p>Elevators have come a long way since the first conventional passenger elevator built in the 19th century. At the same time, however, the basic design of the lift has remained very similar to the original. Despite this, elevators still managed to change the way we live in modern society and continue to do so today. To learn more about the magnificent invention that is the elevator, we will go over its past, present, and future in a (very) brief history. Let's begin, shall we?</p>
    <h1 class="heading">Elevator Past</h1>

    <p>If you ask any Joe Schmoe on the streets who invented the elevator, they will likey say Mr. OTIS, that is if they say anything at all. If this were the case, elevators would be a fairly modern device. Surprisingly, however, elevators are older than Christ himself, with the first elevator recorded in 436 B.C. This elevator was built by the famous mathematician Archimedes, thus making him the true inventor of the elevator. Since then, numerous historical records have pointed to the use of elevators, often described as cabs on cannabis (weed) based ropes. In medieval times, the use of a screw-drive based system took effect. This helped pave the way for the modern passenger elevator, despite the fact that most modern elevators are either cable-driven (traction) or hydraulic.</p>
    <p>The start of the industrial era marked the beginning of the elevator's rise to its popularity we see today. Elevators became more and more prevalent. They could be seen in coal mines, palaces, or novelty attractions. Then, in 1852, Elisha Otis introduced a revolutionary elevator technology: the safety brake. This device, which was found on his elevator model dubbed the "Safety Elevator," prevented the elevator from entering a state of freefall if the its ropes broke. The invention stole the hearts of the people in 1854 when OTIS presented it at the Crystal Palace. Every hour, he would cut the rope suspending his elevator in front of an audience with him on board (seen in the picture above). The brake would take action in a matter of seconds, keeping him and the contraption safe.</p>
    <P>The first modern passenger elevator was then installed by OTIS Elevator Co. 3 years later in 1857. Up until then, OTIS Elevator had only made freight elevators. The first electric elevator was built by Werner von Siemens in 1880. Other elevator companies began to appear. Rotary/Dover, Oliver-Williams, Montgomery, Schindler, Haughton, and Westinghouse are a few examples. Up until 1924, elevators were operated exclusively manually by elevator operators. Then, OTIS Elevator company introduced the automatic elevator. This system allowed the user to operate the elevator via pushbuttons as we do today.</p>
    <h1 class="heading">Elevator Present</h1>

    <p>Recent advancements like the autmatic door operator and improved safety brakes have made elevators more safe than ever. Now, almost all elevators are operated by a user-friendly pushbutton interface. Elevator controllers have been optimised to get you to your destination as efficiently as possible. With the introduction of the Machine Room-less elevator by KONE in 1996, a device which at one time could take up hundreds of square feet can now fit in the area of a storage closet. </p>
    <p>Still, with all these advancements, the elevator's upward journey hasn't stopped. New elevator technology known as Destination Dispatch now allows users to choose their destination floor before entering an elevator. This allows the system to group passengers with similar destinations in the same elevator, thus increasing efficiency and decreasing wait times significantly. With ThyssenKrupp Elevator's recent introduction of the TWIN system, two elevators can run in one shaft; something that could only be dreamt of back in Elisha Otis' time.</p>
    <p>Without the elevator, today's skyline would be impossible. Buildings would be limited to 5 or 6 stories at the most. Our economy, especially real estate, would be completely different. The large amount of disabled people would be unable to live the full lives they have today. Their mobility would be kept at ground level, preventing them from entering most modern structures. It is an unquestionable fact that elevators have indeed changed our world, but they aren't even close to done...</p>
    <h1 class="heading">Elevator Future</h1>
    <img class="image" src="https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/assets/images/layout/footer_bro.jpg" height="200" width="auto">
    <p>Only time will tell what the future holds for the elevator. We do, however, know that there are plans for future elevator advancement. The best example of this would be ThyssenKrupp Elevator's MULTI system. As if having two cars in one shaft wasn't enough, ThyssenKrupp went on to create a system allowing for several cars in one shaft. Additionally, these cars are comletely free of cables, but can still travel the same distance as a typical traction elevator. These elevators can also travel sideways and diagonally, making them less of an elevator and more of a trans-building railway! This revolutionary technology will increase building mobility and allow for new building designs. Most importantly, it will allow all of us to ride Willy Wonka's super-elevator for ourselves!</p>
    <p>Though most elevators these days are hoisted up by ropes or pushed up by a hydraulic ram, pnuematic elevators do indeed exist. Future developement could allow pnuematic elevators to expand beyong their current residential-exclusive applications, thus making perhaps the most compact elevator in history. A space elevator has also been in discussion for quite some time now. If technology continues to advance at its current rate, all of these future elevator advancements will likely be a reality in the near future. Until then, however, we can take this time to enjoy the elevators we have in the present, before they (if ever) become obscolete.</p>
