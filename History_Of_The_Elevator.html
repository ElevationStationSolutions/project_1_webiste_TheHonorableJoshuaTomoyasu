      <h2 class="heading">Elevators Then and Now</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Elevators have come a long way since the first conventional passenger elevator built in the 19th century. At the same time, however, the basic design of the lift has remained very similar to the original. Despite this, elevators still managed to change the way we live in modern society and continue to do so today. To learn more about the magnificent invention that is the elevator, we will go over its past, present, and future in a (very) brief history. Let's begin, shall we?</p>

    <p>If you ask any Joe Schmoe on the streets who invented the elevator, they will likey say Mr. OTIS, that is if they say anything at all. If this were the case, elevators would be a fairly modern device. Surprisingly, however, elevators are older than Christ himself, with the first elevator recorded in 436 B.C. This elevator was built by the famous mathematician Archimedes, thus making him the true inventor of the elevator. Since then, numerous historical records have pointed to the use of elevators, often described as cabs on cannabis (weed) based ropes. In medieval times, the use of a screw-drive based system took effect. This helped pave the way for the modern passenger elevator, despite the fact that most modern elevators are either cable-driven (traction) or hydraulic.</p>
    <p>The start of the industrial era also marked the beginning of the elevator's rise to its popularity we see today. Elevators became more and more prevalent. They could be seen in coal mines, palaces, or novelty attractions. Then, in 1852, Elisha Otis introduced a revolutionary elevator technology: the safety brake. This device, which was found on his elevator model dubbed the "Safety Elevator," prevented the elevator from entering a state of freefall if the its ropes broke. The invention stole the hearts of the people in 1854 when OTIS presented it at the Crystal Palace. Every hour, he would cut the rope suspending his elevator in front of an audience with him on board (seen in the picture above). The brake would take action in a matter of seconds, keeping him and the contraption safe.</p>
    <P>The first modern passenger elevator was then installed by OTIS Elevator Co. 3 years later in 1857. Up until then, OTIS Elevator had only made freight elevators. The first electric elevator was built by Werner von Siemens in 1880. Other elevator companies began to appear. Rotary/Dover, Oliver-Williams, Montgomery, Schindler, Haughton, and Westinghouse are a few examples. Up until 1924, elevators were operated exclusively manually by elevator operators. Then, OTIS Elevator company introduced the automatic elevator. This system allowed the user to operate the elevator via pushbuttons as we do today.
