    <p>Elevators are the safest form off transportation in the world. Not the second safest or one of the safest... They are THE safest hands down. Despite this, numerous elevator related injuries and deaths occure each year, largely due to user error. Hundereds of safety features are in effect in the elevator system, however it is ultimately the riders' respobsibility to make use of these systems and ride responsibly. Below is a list of basic rules to follow when enjoying the beautiful work of engineering that is the elevator. By abiding by these rules, you are practically ALWAYS gauranteed a safe, enjoyable, and comfortable ride.</p>
    <h3>Elevator Safety Tips:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To avoid disrupting elevator traffic and out of respect, press the call button for your direction ONCE. Additionally, know your destination before entering the elevator.</li>
      <li>When entering the elevator, watch your step! Before boarding, allow any passengers to exit and let the elderly and crippled board first. Make sure the elevator is level with the floor, and NEVER enter an elevator that is parked more than 5 inches from the landing!</li>
      <li>Pay attention to warnings! NEVER ENTER AN ELEVATOR THAT IS MALFUNCTIONING!</li>
      <li>Once on board, use the "Door Open" and/or "Door Hold" buttons to hold the door when needed. Do not hold them open with your hands and keep all body parts AWAY from the doors.</li>
      <li>Keep an eye on the young'uns, and NEVER operate a freight elevator if you are under 18.</li>
      <li>If the elevator makes an unexpected stop and you become trapped, remain calm and DO NOT TRY TO ESCAPE THE ELEVATOR! There is no need to panic as you are completely safe in the elevator. Make sure those around you are also calm, and use the emergency phone or alarm to summon assistance. Help will arrive shortly!</li>
      <li>In the event of a fire, do NOT use the elevator. Take the stairs.</li>
      <li>When exiting the elevator, exit quickly as to not hold up traffic.</li>
      <li>Never tamper with an elevator without proper training and permission. This can lead to serious injury or death!</li>
      <li>Last but not least, DO NOT JUMP IN THE ELEVATOR! People get stuck in elevators and have an awkward story to explain to the fire department all because they jumped at the wrong time. DON'T BE THAT GUY!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Escalator/Moving Walkway Safety Tips:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prior to boarding a moving walk or escalator, make sure all shoe laces and other dangling items are secured.</li>
      <li>Step onto the escalator/moving walk with caution and always keep a grasp on the handrail.</li>
      <li>If you choose to walk, do so on the proper side of the escalator/walkway. Check your country's  guidelines as this rule varies from place to place.</li>
      <li>Always stand up and face forward. Don't sit on the steps of an escalator or the belt of a moving walk.</li>
      <li>Escalators and moving walks are traveling a certain way for a reason. Don't be stupid... Don't travel on a device moving in the opposite direction -_-</li>
      <li>Don't try to do tricks or tamper with escalators or moving walks. It looks cool... That is until you break the device, end up seriously injured, and charged with repair fees and criminal mischief.</li>
      <li>Don't bring carts, bicyles, strollers, pets, or anything that shouldn't be on an escalator on an escalator. That's why we have elevators!</li>
      <li>Walk off of the end of the escalator or moving walk quickly so others may do so.</li>
      <li>Watch your kids. Hold their hands while on an escalator or moving walk.</li>
      <li>People think that a stalled escalator is just a staircase. This is anything BUT the truth. Escalator steps are steeper than those of a normal staircase, and stopped escalators may spontainiously begin moving. Broken/stopped escalators should not be used as stairs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="heading">The Bottom Line:</h2>
    <p>The truth of the matter is that if you're not stupid, you are likely never to get injured on an elevator, escalator, or moving walkway. Most of these rules are common sense, however people still get injured every year on vertical transportation. Let's stop this trend! If you see unsafe behavior around vertical transportation, STOP IT! Not all heroes wear capes...</p>
