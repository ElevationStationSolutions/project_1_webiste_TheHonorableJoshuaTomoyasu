    <h3>Elevator Safety Tips:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To avoid disrupting elevator traffic and out of respect, press the call button for your direction ONCE. Additionally, know your destination before entering the elevator.</li>
      <li>When entering the elevator, watch your step! Before boarding, allow any passengers to exit and let the elderly and crippled board first. Make sure the elevator is level with the floor, and NEVER enter an elevator that is parked more than 5 inches from the landing!</li>
      <li>Pay attention to warnings! NEVER ENTER AN ELEVATOR THAT IS MALFUNCTIONING!</li>
      <li>Once on board, use the "Door Open" and/or "Door Hold" buttons to hold the door when needed. Do not hold them open with your hands and keep all body parts AWAY from the doors.</li>
      <li>Keep an eye on the young'uns, and NEVER operate a freight elevator if you are under 18.</li>
      <li>If the elevator makes an unexpected stop and you become trapped, remain calm and DO NOT TRY TO ESCAPE THE ELEVATOR! There is no need to panic as you are completely safe in the elevator. Make sure those around you are also calm, and use the emergency phone or alarm to summon assistance. Help will arrive shortly!</li>
      <li>In the event of a fire, do NOT use the elevator. Take the stairs.</li>
      <li>When exiting the elevator, exit quickly as to not hold up traffic.</li>
      <li>Never tamper with an elevator without proper training and permission. This can lead to serious injury or death!</li>
      <li>Last but not least, DO NOT JUMP IN THE ELEVATOR! People get stuck in elevators and have an awkward story to explain to the fire department all because they jumped at the wrong time. DON'T BE THAT GUY!</li>
    </ol>
